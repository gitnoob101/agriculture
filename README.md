KrishiSetu Backend üåæ
This repository contains the backend service for KrishiSetu, an AI-powered platform for farmers. Built with FastAPI, this application provides a robust API for agricultural advisories, plant disease detection, and a powerful autonomous sales agent.

‚ú® Features
Proactive Sales Agent: A LangChain-powered autonomous agent that scans a mock marketplace, calculates optimal prices, and submits quotes on behalf of the farmer.

AI-Powered Advisory: Integrates with the Dhenu 2 LLM to provide detailed, 7-day agricultural advisories based on hyperlocal weather and soil data.

Plant Disease Detection: Uses the Google Gemini 1.5 Flash model to analyze uploaded images of plants and provide a diagnosis in Hindi.

Robust & Scalable: Built with FastAPI and Pydantic for high performance and automatic data validation.

Cloud-Ready: Designed for easy deployment as a containerized application on services like Google Cloud Run.

üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
Framework: FastAPI

Agent Framework: LangChain

AI Models: Google Gemini 1.5 Flash, Dhenu 2

Data Handling: Pydantic, Pandas

Deployment: Docker, Google Cloud Run

API Endpoints
The API provides three main endpoints to power the frontend application.

1. General Agricultural Advisory
Endpoint: POST /general_advisory/

Description: Fetches hyperlocal weather and soil data for a given location and generates a detailed 7-day action plan for a specific crop using the Dhenu 2 model.

Request Body:

{
  "latitude": 28.6139,
  "longitude": 77.209,
  "crop": "Wheat",
  "language": "Hindi"
}

Success Response:

{
  "advisory_report": "Weekly Focus: Critical irrigation management due to rising temperatures...\nDisease Risk Alert: Moderate risk of Powdery Mildew...\nDay-by-Day Action Plan:..."
}

2. Plant Disease Detection
Endpoint: POST /detect/

Description: Accepts an image of a plant and a text context. It uses the Gemini 1.5 Flash model to analyze the image and provide a diagnosis and recommendation in Hindi.

Request Body: multipart/form-data

image: The image file of the plant.

plant_name: (string) The name of the plant, e.g., "Tomato".

context: (string) The user's query in their native language, e.g., "‡§à ‡§ó‡•á‡§π‡•Ç‡§Ç ‡§ï‡•á ‡§´‡§∏‡§≤ ‡§π, ‡§è‡§ï‡§∞ ‡§ï‡§æ ‡§≠‡§á‡§≤".

Success Response:

{
  "plant": "Tomato",
  "filename": "leaf_image.jpg",
  "analysis": "‡§µ‡§ø‡§∂‡•ç‡§≤‡•á‡§∑‡§£: ‡§™‡•å‡§ß‡•á ‡§Æ‡•á‡§Ç ‡§™‡§æ‡§â‡§°‡§∞‡•Ä ‡§Æ‡§ø‡§≤‡•ç‡§°‡•ç‡§Ø‡•Ç ‡§ï‡•á ‡§≤‡§ï‡•ç‡§∑‡§£ ‡§¶‡§ø‡§ñ ‡§∞‡§π‡•á ‡§π‡•à‡§Ç..."
}

3. Proactive Sales Agent
Endpoint: POST /setuAgent

Description: Activates the autonomous LangChain agent. The agent scans a mock B2B marketplace, analyzes market conditions, calculates an optimal price, and submits a quote for the farmer's produce.

Request Body:

{
  "farmer_name": "Ramesh Kumar",
  "commodity": "Basmati Rice",
  "grade": "A",
  "minimum_price": 3500,
  "location": "Karnal, Haryana"
}

Success Response:

{
  "agent_run_log": "ü§ñ PROACTIVE AI SALES AGENT ACTIVATED...\n\nüîç SCANNING: Looking for 'Basmati Rice' (Grade A) opportunities...\n‚úÖ Found 3 matching opportunities!\n...etc."
}
